# NODE101 Movie Finder Data

This is my third project in the Node 101 Module at the San Diego Code School.
Here we implement more Express, Morgan and Axios NPM packages into our project.

I'll update you with my progress here.

My brain is seriously broken.

(But I am glad Coach Michael Roberts Jr. believes in me and calls me out in class.)



## Introduction

Consider a situation where you're building a website that lets users search for their favorite movies, and you use [OMDB](https://omdbapi.com) as your data source, for example:

Imagine that it takes 500ms for OMDB to respond to a request at that particular URL. When OMDB starts receiving a large number of requests at that URL, the server will start to slow down as it has to process each and every request. As more requests come in, responses start taking 600ms... 700ms.. 800ms.. to respond, until eventually they start timing out. 

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## Run

```
$ npm start or

$ npm run dev
```
